## Usage

### Getting Card Data
1. Download UABE from [here](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor)
2. Run AssetBundleExtractor.exe (Note: this is a windows only tool).
3. File -> Open -> Select "Path\to\Gwent\GWENT_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles\data_definitions". You will prompted to unpack the file, do that. Then click info.
4. Find the GwentCardTemplates asset.
5. Click export raw and save that file as 'GwentCardTemplates.dat'.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the following assets: "GwentCardAbilities", "GwentTooltips", "cards_en-US" "tooltips_en-US". Save them all in the same directory.
7. Run file_setup.sh passing in the directory that contains the .dat files.
    e.g ./file_setup.sh --inputs path/to/folder/with/.dat/files/
8. Run process_xml.py, passing in the outputs folder from step 8.
    e.g. ./process_xml.py ../outputs/

### Handling Card Images
CDPR provides us with card images, but they have bright green backgrounds. We will use ImageMagick to handle them. 

1. Install ImageMagick and unrar with "apt-get install ImageMagick" and "apt-get install unrar"
2. Unzip the rar file from CDPR using "unrar e Example.rar"
3. Run scripts/makeTransparent.sh passing in the directory of the unzipped images as an argument. e.g. "./makeTransparent.sh --inputs ./images"

Optional (If you want to save the cards with in the file structure "images/cardId/variationId/fullsize.png" and varied image sizes):
4. Run scripts/sortImages.py passing in the directory of the images as an argument. e.g. "./sortImages.py ./images"
