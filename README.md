# Roach for Gwent

Android Application that helps you manage your decks and collection, as well as tracking your results. Download the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamieadkins.gwent).

# Note to Devs

This app uses firebase as a backend, and as a result, you'll need to set up your own firebase project if you want to test your fork. I need to write up a guide for that. Until then, message me if you have any problems!
