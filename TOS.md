#1. Roach for Gwent

##Your Roach account
If you create an account with Roach, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of , your account, or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

##Responsibility of Contributors
If you publish Content publically to Roach, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Roach, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms. By making Content you have submitted to Roach public, you give other Roach users permission to share your Content and add their own Content to it, without attribution. If you delete Content, Roach will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the application, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of Roach to any individual or entity for any reason. Roach will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

##Payment and Renewal
Optional paid services such as the Pro upgrade are available (any such services, an “Upgrade”). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Roach the one off fee indicated for that service.

#2. Responsibility of Visitors.

Roach has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating our Services, We do not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Roach disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.

#3. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As Roach asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Roach violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the application if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Roach or others. In the case of such termination, Roach will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.

#\5. Changes.

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by notifying you within the application or by other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

#\6. Termination.

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Roach account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services.

(“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the UK, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court.

You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Roach may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition.
