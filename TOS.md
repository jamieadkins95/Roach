#\1. Yennefr for Gwent

##Your Yennefr Account and Website
If you create an account with Yennefr, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and blog, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the blog. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account, or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
##Responsibility of Contributors
 If you publish Content publically to Yennefr, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using Yennefr, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these terms or the User Guidelines. By submitting Content to Yennefr, you give other Yennefr users permission to share your Content and add their own Content to it, without attribution. If you delete Content, Yennefr will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the application, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of Yennefr to any individual or entity for any reason. Yennefr will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
##Analytics
We use a third party, Firebase, Inc. (“Firebase”), to measure Yennefr's audience and usage. By using Yennefr, you agree to Yennefr sending anonymous crash reports using Firebase to help improve the Yennefr product.
##Payment and Renewal
Optional paid services such as the Pro upgrade are available (any such services, an “Upgrade”). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Yennefr the one off fee indicated for that service.

#\2. Responsibility of Visitors.

Yennefr has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating our Services, We do not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Yennefr disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.

#\3. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As Yennefr asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Yennefr violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the application if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Yennefr or others. In the case of such termination, Yennefr will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.

#\4. Intellectual Property.

This Agreement does not transfer from Yennefr to you any Yennefr or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Yennefr.

Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Yennefr or third-party trademarks.

#\5. Changes.

We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by notifying you within the application or by other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.

#\6. Termination.

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Yennefr account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Yennefr and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Yennefr, or by the posting by Yennefr of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the United Kingdom ("UK"), excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the courts located in the United Kingdom. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in the UK, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Yennefr may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
